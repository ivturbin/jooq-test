# SpringBoot App with JOOQ Test Project

This project demonstrates the integration of JOOQ (Java Object Oriented Querying) with a Spring Boot application for executing efficient database queries, using PostgreSQL as the underlying database.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 or higher
- Gradle
- PostgreSQL DataBase
- An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for easier development (optional)

## Usage

This project contains several example queries implemented using JOOQ. These queries demonstrate how to interact with the database using JOOQ's fluent API. You can find these queries in the `src/main/java/dev.turbin.jooqtest.dao` package.

Feel free to explore and modify the queries according to your requirements. Additionally, you can extend this project by adding more complex queries or integrating additional functionalities.
